# Image-registration-in-AM
This repository contains a collection of scripts, models, and utilities for performing image registration on 3D datasets, particularly focused on Additive Manufacturing (AM) using the VoxelMorph model. The project aims to accurately align XCT and CAD data to evaluate deformations and improve quality control.
