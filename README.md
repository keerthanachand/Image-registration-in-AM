# Image Registration for Additive Manufacturing using VoxelMorph

This repository contains a collection of scripts, models, and utilities for performing image registration on 3D datasets, particularly focused on Additive Manufacturing (AM) using the VoxelMorph model. The project aims to accurately align XCT and CAD data to evaluate deformations and improve quality control.

## Features
- **VoxelMorph Model** for unsupervised 3D image registration.
- **Support for Additive Manufacturing**: Handles complex deformations in AM datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to filter, normalize, and prepare data for registration.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize deformation fields and registered volumes.

## Project Structure
- **scripts/**: Main scripts for registration, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **models/**: Code for training and using the VoxelMorph model.
- **utils/**: Helper functions for image processing, metrics, and data loading.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for critical components of the code.
- **notebooks/**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for training and demonstration.
